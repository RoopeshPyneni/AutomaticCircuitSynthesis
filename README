---> main_loss1.py
This file contains the program that will call the complete optimization function
You can specify very different parameters in this program that are input to the optimization function
This is used for loss optimization

---> main_fom1.py
This file contains the program that will call the complete optimization function
You can specify very different parameters in this program that are input to the optimization function
This is used for FOM optimization

---> main_single_point.py
This file is used to extract the outputs for a single input point
This will call the functions in spectre and run the calculation

---> complete_optimization.py
This file is used to run the complete otpimization
It will perform optimization in the following steps:
	1. Pre Optimization
	2. Optimization Function
	3. Temperature Analysis
