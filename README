Files in this folder:

---> main_optimization_CS_LNA.py ; main_optimization_CG_LNA.py 
These files contain programs that will call the complete optimization function
You can specify very different parameters in this program that are input to the optimization function

---> main_single_point.py
This file is used to extract the output for a single input point
This code will run spectre and display the outputs

---> complete_optimization.py
This file is used to run the complete otpimization
It will perform optimization in the following steps:
	1. Pre Optimization
	2. Optimization Function
	3. Other analysis post optimization

---> CS_LNA ; CG_LNA
These folders contain the following files:
		
	---> pre_optimization.py
	This file will run the pre optimization steps ( hand calculations and some parameter corrections )
	It will store the results after each step in this process
	
		---> hand_calculation.py
		This file will do hand calculations by choosing an initial point and making some changes
		There might be more than one hand calculation files which set the initial point in different ways

	---> spectre.py
	This file contains the class Circuit
	This class contains functions that will initialize the circuit parameters, run spectre and store the extracted parameters
	It will also contain the loss function that is used for optimization. 

---> optimization.py
This file will run the optimization
It will store the results of each optimization step
This file will also plot thr results

---> spectre_common.py
This file will contain common functions used by the spectre file in CS_LNA, CG_LNA.
It will contain functions such as iip3 calculation, Zin calculation from s11 which is common to different circuits.

---> spectre_run.tcsh
This file is the list of shell commands to run the spectre file

---> common_functions.py
This file contains many functions that are used commonly such as print statements for circuit and extracted parameters, conversion from db to linear scale, etc.

---> Analysis
This folder contains different analysis files that are used post optimization

	---> temperature_analysis.py
	This file is used to perform the temperature analysis by varying temperature over a chosen range and calculating the extracted parameters

	---> process_analysis.py
	This file is used to perform the process analysis by calculating the extracted parameters at FF, SS, TT corners. We can also vary temperature in this analysis.

	---> frequency_analysis.py
	This file is used to perform the frenquency analysis by varying the frequency over a chosen range and calculating the extracted parameters.

	---> iip3_analysis.py
	This file is used to perform the iip3 analysis by sweeping the pin and plotting the value of Pfund and Pim3. This is done to verify if the slope of Pfund and Pim3 are 1 and 3. 

	---> sensitivity_analysis.py
	This file is used to perform the sensitivity analysis by varying the circuit parameters by 1% and finding the sensitivity of the output. 

---> MOS_Files
This folder contains the files for different mosfets which contains values such as Vdd, Lmin, un, cox, MOSFET file location in system, etc.

---> Spectre_Run
This folder contains spectre_run.tcsh files that are used for CS_LNA to run three circuits in parallel.
Since we are running in paralle, we do not want to call the same spectre_run.tcsh.
