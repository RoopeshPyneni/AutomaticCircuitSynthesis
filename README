Files in this folder:

---> main.py
This file contains the program that will call the main optimization function
You can very different parameters in this program that are input to the optimization function

---> complete_optimization.py
This file is used to run the complete otpimization
It will perform optimization in the following steps:
	1. Operating Point Calculations
		1a. Operating Points are calculated based on the MOSFET Characteristics and Required Output Conditions
		1b. Operating Points values are checked with the simulation; Values such as Vt may vary due to channel length variation. These values are now updated and the function is run again
	2. gm Updation
		This step will ensure that the value of gm and vdsat are close to the desired values. 
		We do operating point calculation assuming a square law device. However, this is not 100% accurate. 
		This function will iterative try to get gm and vdsat closer to the desired values
	3. Optimization Function
		This function will try to do the optimization for current
		It will ensure that the values of s11, gain, iip3 and noise are within the limits
		It will use gradient descent to optimize the values
